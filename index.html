        <h1>H1 Diff√©rent</h1>
		<p>Every night in my dreams I see you, I feel you,
That is how I know you go on.
Far across the distance and spaces between us
You have come to show you go on.

Near, far, wherever you are.
I believe that the heart does go on.
Once more, you open the door 
And you're here in my heart, 
And my heart will go on.

Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you, one true time I hold to.
In my life we'll always go on.

Near, far, wherever you are.
I believe that the heart does go on.
Once more, you open the door 
And you're here in my heart, 
And my heart will go on.

You're here, there's nothing I fear,
And I know that my heart will go on.
We'll stay forever this way,
You are safe in my heart,</p>
